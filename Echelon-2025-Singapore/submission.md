# Workshop | Scale Smarter: Cloud Efficiency Meets GenAI Innovation

## Abstract

This workshop explores how to build **cost-efficient, production-ready GenAI solutions** by aligning cloud architecture with practical AI capabilities. We start from a real-world **Technical Support Assistant demo** and unpack the end-to-end system: speech input, multimodal vision with **Llama 3.2 Vision Instruct** on GPU droplets, retrieval and orchestration via a managed GenAI platform, object storage for image handling, and streamlined web and FastAPI services.

Attendees learn the **reference workflow** from user input to model inference and back, along with decisions that balance performance, latency, and spend. We cover **component tradeoffs** such as GPU sizing, model selection, storage patterns, and speech pipelines, and share a **tuning playbook** for temperature, top k, and max tokens.

The session outlines **next steps** including adopting Whisper for speech to text, Dia for text to speech, introducing child agents and function routing, and using agent insights for observability and cost control.

## Key Topics

- **End-to-end GenAI system architecture** with real-world demo
- **Cloud cost optimization** strategies for AI workloads
- **Component tradeoffs** and performance tuning
- **Multimodal AI integration** (speech, vision, text)
- **Production deployment patterns** with FastAPI and web services
- **Agent versioning and metrics-driven optimization**

## Workshop Outcomes

Participants leave with a **clear blueprint** to scale smarter: deliver responsive GenAI experiences, reduce total cost of ownership, and iterate safely with agent versioning and metrics-driven optimization.
