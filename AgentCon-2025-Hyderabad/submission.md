# Shipping Reliable Agents with LangChain and LangGraph, Accelerated with langchain-gradient

## Abstract

Agent demos are fun, but production agents are hard. In this demo-first talk, I'll showcase a complete agent workflow with LangChain and LangGraph, and demonstrate how **langchain-gradient** (a developer tool I built) enables fast iteration with just a few lines of code and flexible model choice to arrive at the best solution. We'll walk through the open-source **Product Launch Assistant** that plans, researches, drafts, and reviews launch assets end to end.

## What You'll See

- **Modeling multi-node agent graphs** with guards, fallbacks, and retries
- **Practical tool-use patterns** (web search, RAG, structured outputs)
- **Implementing memory and state management**
- **Evaluating LLMs per task** to choose the right model
- **Tactics for latency control and cost visibility**

## Key Takeaways

You'll leave with a **reusable template and repo** to ship agent workflows with confidence: fewer failures, faster iteration, and production-grade reliability.
