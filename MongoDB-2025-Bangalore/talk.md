# From Chatbots to Autonomous Agents: The Next Leap in AI

## Abstract

This talk traces the evolution from traditional chatbots to fully autonomous AI agents, outlining the architectural shifts, enabling technologies, and practical frameworks that make the next leap in AI possible. Starting with basic, rules-driven chatbots and progressing through RAG-enhanced systems that ground LLMs in enterprise knowledge, we unpack how agents add **planning, tool use, memory, and multi-step reasoning** to move from answering questions to completing goals.

We examine a canonical agent workflow: **step generation, tool selection, execution, and progress evaluation**, and show how multi-agent patterns (for example, CrewAI) coordinate specialized roles to tackle complex tasks. The session highlights real-world agentic applications, such as **autonomous warehouse robots** for navigation, retrieval, and inventory optimization, and surveys the current ecosystem of frameworks and tools (**AutoGen, MetaGPT, crewAI, LangGraph, Swarm, n8n, Flowwise, Langflow, Gumloop**) that accelerate prototyping and deployment.

## Key Topics

- **Evolution of AI systems** from chatbots to autonomous agents
- **Architectural patterns** for goal-directed AI systems
- **Multi-agent coordination** and specialized role management
- **Real-world applications** in warehouse automation and beyond
- **Framework ecosystem** for rapid agent development
- **Design considerations** for reliability and safety

## Takeaways

Attendees will gain a **practical mental model** for when to use RAG chatbots versus autonomous agents, design considerations for reliability and safety, and a **curated roadmap** to start building goal-directed, tool-using agents that operate with minimal human intervention.
